fey init
	-Creates .fey file

Adding local aliases	[fey alias command]
	-fey alias1 "ls -l"
	-fey add "alias2"
		-Open up editor of choice to input bash commands

Using local aliases
	-fey alias1 (add fey in front of command; personally am going to remap to f)

Directory structure
	.fey
		|_alias1.sh
		|_alias2.sh
		|_alias3.sh

fey add creates
	***alias1.sh***	(fey add will have to give chmod +x access)
	#!/bin/bash
	command

fey alias2 executes
	cd current_location (get by using pwd)
	Keep going up until you find the .fey file
	.fey/[second_argument]


|_.fey/ (project root)
|	|_alias1.sh
|
|_working_directory/
	|_test.hi (created by fey)
	**execute "fey alias1"**


Testing plan: 
	Alias "fey" to be "/home/kevin/projects/fey/fey.sh"
	Inside fey.rb: 
		-pwd to see where to execute
		-From pwd keep going up until finds .fey file
		-Read the commands and cd back to pwd location
		-Execute the file
